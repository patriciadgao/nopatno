<p>You may be wondering who's behind this whole webcomic thing.</p>
<p>That would be <b>me.</b></p> 
<p>My name is Pat and I'm a college student.
I took a comic-writing class last semester and figured that 
creating and updating this website would be a <b>great</b> way to 
<s>procrastinate everything else</s> spend my time.</p>
<p>Things you may enjoy knowing about me:
<ul><li>I can't cartwheel</li>
  <li>I can't play the clarinet (but I wish I could).</li>
  <li>I own at least one (1) Hat That Other People Would Also Call A Hat (see the <a href="https://nopatno.com">homepage</a>).</li>
  <li>I've got bones.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>If you'd like to <b>contact</b> me, you can bother the No Pat No Instagram
or send an email via the buttons below, but before you do so, <b>I should 
warn you</b> that because I'm wary of the Internet I won't even read your 
email if it doesn't contain the words "fragrance," "adventure," and "hat."
Work those in how you wish.</p>
<p>I don't get paid for making this comic, but if you think I should, 
watch out for a Patreon in the next few months. If you're not a fan ...
I advise you to stay away from this website from now on. â˜º</p>
<p>Who coded this website? That would ALSO be me. Laugh at my code all you want but I bet my laptop stickers are cooler.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading all this! Go read my comics instead! Have a good day!</p>
